Problem Statement


Data: You are given three datasets. Each dataset is in a csv file, where the rows correspond to
documents. Each file has two columns: the first column contains the document id, and the
second column contains the document text.


Task-01: For each of the dataset, your code should be able to do the following:
a. Read the dataset in an appropriate data structure.
b. Tokenize the documents to extract individual terms. Carefully consider the tokenization
decisions.
c. For each document, extract the named entities.
d. For each document, assign POS tags to each token.


Task-02: Once you are able to do the above tasks, generate useful statistics from the dataset
and present them using tables and other visualization techniques. Some of the example
statistics that you can generate are as follows:
a. Frequency statistics of the terms
b. Frequency statistics of the named entities
c. The probability distribution of each of the POS tags
